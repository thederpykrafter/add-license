# add-license

### What & Why
I made this upon realizing that over 40 repos were missing licenses lol


My Directory structure is set up like
- ~
    - Dev
        - sh
            - add-license
                - LICENSE
            - get-repos
                - LICENSE
        - Etc...

### Run
~/path/to/script/add-license


If no license is found The MIT License from this repo is copied.

> If you use this change the license to have your name and year!
